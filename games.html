                                This game was made for the game jam that happened during Lumo LAB's bootcamp, a project from Lumo Entertainment.
                                This was my first time in a 3-week game jam, and my first time in a game jam in a long time overall.
                                This was also where I acted as the main sound designer in a game for the first time!
                                I decided to step in for this task since no one in our group had any idea how to make music or SFX besides me.

                                My first game made as a project for college. Our assignment was to make a mobile platform game, so that's what we did.

                                Burning Down was my first jam game ever.
                                Other than the sound effects, everything was made all by myself.
                                Made for LD49, theme "Unstable".

                                I joined this jam mostly for forcing myself into Unity. I'm glad I managed
                                to put all of this together in under 72 hours. The game was praised for
                                having that much content made by a first timer in such a short time!

                                Animal Crossing meets Danganronpa in this visual novel investigation game, where
                                Shelly and other 15 animals are trapped in an island and forced into a killing
                                game in order to escape.

                                I started working on this game halfway through 2020, kept occasionally working on it
                                until May 2022, and formally canceled it in April 2023, unfortunately.
                                I even tried putting up a team of artists, voice actors and other roles for this,
                                but they never had the chance to do any actual work.

                                Even though this game will never come out, it did make me learn a lot about
                                game development and coding — especially if you consider GameMaker is NOT an
                                engine made for 3D games — and ultimately set GM as my main game engine.
