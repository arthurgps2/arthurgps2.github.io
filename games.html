                                <p class="card-text">My latest project, also the one I was in charge for most stuff. Made for the 44th gm48 game jam. Theme was "Delivery". Used gm48's Leaderboards along with some shader work in this game.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Made for the 43rd gm48, theme "Spellcasting". It was supposed to be a sequel to a previous jam game, Dantoma. Though I don't really like the result of it, at least I got to play a little more with procedural generation.</p>

Shame it'll never see the light of day üòî, but one day a "spiritual successor" to it, who knows? (Also play around the options, there are lots of cool stuff I added)</p>
